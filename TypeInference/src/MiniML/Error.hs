-- A computation that may return an error. It is used by the typechecking and
-- evaluation functions.

-- `Error` is defined as a type alias for `Either`, where the left value
-- represents an error (with a position and an error message), and the right
-- value represents a successful result.

-- The `Either` type has a `Monad` instance (it's provided by the Haskell base
-- library) and it is similar to the `Maybe` monad. Therefore, Error is also a
-- Monad and computations can be sequenced using monadic operations.

-- You can find more about the Either data type here
-- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Data-Either.html
